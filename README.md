## About
This project was created for The Odin Project's [Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) section with the main objectives being to practice working with promises and APIs. The weather app uses the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) API. Users can enter a desired location to get the current weather there.
<br/><br/>
These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- Accessing the weather data (JSON) from the API
- Displaying the 'loading' component in the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API
